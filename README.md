## Privacy Policy

1. Introduction

Welcome to What’s For Dinner! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app. In short: we don’t collect or store any personal data on external servers.

2. Information We Collect

We do not collect, process, or store any personal data outside of your device. All data, such as dish names, preferences, and meal history, remains on your device and is never sent to external servers. If you enable iCloud backup, your data may be stored in your own iCloud account, managed by Apple.

3. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any data, there is no external processing of your information. The app functions entirely offline, and any data you enter (such as meal history) is stored only on your device for your personal use. The only exception is when you manually export or share data via the built-in share functionality.

4. Data Storage and Security
	•	All data stays on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.
	•	If iCloud is enabled on your device, data may be stored in your iCloud account, managed by Apple.
	•	We do not sell, share, or use your data for analytics or advertising.
	•	You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time.

5. Sharing and Third Parties

Since we do not collect any data, we do not share data with third parties. The only way data can leave your device is if you choose to share it manually.

6. Your Rights and Choices
	•	You can delete your data at any time by removing the app or resetting stored data in the app settings.
	•	If you export your meal list, you are responsible for how you share and store that data.
	•	No additional app permissions are required beyond what is necessary for core functionality.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Because we do not collect or process user data, changes to this policy are unlikely. However, if we ever make adjustments, they will be reflected in the app settings.
